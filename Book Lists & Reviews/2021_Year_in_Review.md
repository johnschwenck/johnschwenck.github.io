![alt text](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/Book Lists & Reviews/book_images/biggestbluff.jpg?raw=true) best book by far

##### Madhouse at the End of the Earth: The Belgica's Journey Into the Dark Antarctic Night by Julian Sancton - 5/5
My favorite of 2021

##### The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey by Candice Millard - 5/5
Anyone who knows me knows I love TR

##### Ticker: The Quest to Create an Artificial Heart by Mimi Swartz - 5/5
Heart Condition

##### Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future by Peter Thiel & Blake Masters - 5/5
Ironically, despite a 5/5, this book was the last startup/business/how-to book I've decided to read for a while

##### The Man Who solved the Market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution by Gregory Zuckerman - 5/5
fantastic book about quants and rentec

##### Decision Points by George W. Bush - 5/5
Whether you love or hate him, this book provides insight to his thought process

##### I Hear You: The Surprisingly Simple Skill Behind Extraordinary Relationships by Michael S Sorenson - 4/5
While the title may lead you to believe that this is a book about romantic relationship advice (which to an extent it is), there is much more to be gleaned from the author's insight into human nature and the social need for validation. The author gives countless examples of how to utilize otherwise common sense life principles (active listening, compassion, validation, etc) in all aspects of life to diffuse tense situations. Whether an argument with a spouse or collaboration with a stubborn co-worker or even how to fire someone in a way that de-escalates animosity toward one another (i.e. help them look for future work, etc). An unexpectedly splendid read.

##### Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life by Nir Eyal - 3/5
ok

##### Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts by Annie Duke - 1/5
Admittedly, my 2/5 rating is a review in hindsight. After reading The Biggest Bluff, this book was a huge let down. It reiterated the same basic life lesson over and over and over again.
