> Welcome to my site! My name is John Schwenck and I am an aspiring statistician with an adventurous spirit trying to change the world one iteration at a time. I am interested the general domain of machine learning, but specifically in computationally-intensive areas such as Bayesian inference, dimensionality reduction, spatial interaction networks, and natural language processing (NLP). I find enjoyment in applying these methodologies to professional endeavors such as commodity market predictions, reservoir charicterization, and biostatistical applications, but also on a leisurely level with Poker and sports analytics.

### Professional Experience
I have 3 years of professional work experience at **SJI** (a $2.1B natural gas local distribution company formerly known as South Jersey Industries) between my undergraduate and graduate education, where I parlayed my quantitative savvy to optimize departmental metrics across the company as a **Senior Analyst** and implemented a wide variety of statistical methodologies to improve performance. I was tasked with devising profitable natural gas trading strategies, developing empirical data-driven HR screening protocols, and efficiently allocating resources for the damage prevention department to minimize their risk profile through the use of machine learing, among other projects. In addition to my time at SJI, I have consulted for various firms & individuals independently to assist with statistical modeling and automation tasks. 

I am currently a **Quantitative Analyst at Wells Fargo** in the Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning Center of Excellence (CoE) where I work on devloping and deploying various quantitative models at scale using various big data frameworks such as Spark and Hadoop. In my role, I continuously strive to research and translate the latest statistical and computational academic methodologies from academic literature into production.

### Graduate Education: *Texas A&M University*
I am currently in pursuit of a **Master of Science (M.S.)** degree in **Statistics** at **Texas A&M University** where I have been fortunate enough to enroll in a wide variety of coursework covering both theoretical and computational-related topics. During my first year, I served as the **Lead Statistician** for the **Applied Cognitive & Ergonomics [(ACE) lab](https://acelab.tamu.edu/)** where I oversaw analyses and ensured statistical legitimacy before publication. Throughout both Spring and Fall 2020, I have also served as a Teaching Assistant (GAT) with lab responsibilities for an Intro to Data Science Course that relies on Python programming. 

I currently have the privilege to **work alongside [Dr. Irina Gaynanova](https://irinagain.github.io/) as a graduate researcher** to focus on applying the latest statistical methodologies to Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and other technologies in the health & wearables space. With respect to CGM, I have focused on analyzing glucose level variability via sleep curves and the effect that sleep apnea has on Type II diabetics. While currently under development, I have also been tasked with the creation of an R package that analyzes ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) data which, to our knowledge, is the first ABPM software package (soon to be) publicly available. 

Most recently, I have also been working as a **data scientist / statistical consultant** for the **[Texas A&M Athletics](https://www.tamu.edu/athletics/index.html)** department where I analyze athlete performance from both a physiological and strategic perspective by utilizing high-resolution spatio-temporal and physiological data, and visualizing it via Power BI for coaches and athletes.

### Undergraduate Education: *Penn State University*
I graduated from the **Pennsylvania State University** in 2016 where I **completed over 170 credit hours** towards my undergraduate dual-degrees in **Economics (B.S.)** and **Supply Chain & Information Systems (B.S.)** with a minor in Statistics, and **founded the Penn State Energy Marketing Association [(PSEMA)](https://www.pennstateema.com/)**. PSEMA is the university's first research organization dedicated to collaborating on commodity market research using a variety of statistical models and computational tools to publish monthly market outlook publications.

### Technical Competencies
I maintain an **advanced proficiency** with **R, Python,** and **VBA / Excel** having over 5 years of experience with each, but have also recently gained fluency with **SQL** and **C++**. Additionally, I have extensive professional experience with various visualization software such as **Power BI, Shiny Apps,** and **Dash**, in addition to version control software using **Git/GitHub**.

### Personal Research
In 2019, I rode my bicycle 5,775 miles from New York City to Seward, Alaska to collect granular health and geospatial data for research purposes. Although a pilot study in nature, the data has allowed me to employ various statistical methods to uncover insights in cardiac performance which I hope to replicate in future research with a more representative sample. I am currently evaluating options for developing a mobile application that will allow others to collect the same data to make the study more representative and will implement various machine learning algorithms to enhance personal health and wellbeing. 

All of the data is publicly hosted through the Harvard Dataverse **[here](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/r4r)**
