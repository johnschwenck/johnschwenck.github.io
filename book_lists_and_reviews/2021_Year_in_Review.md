###### My Rating: 5/5

> Easily one of the best books I've ever read. I must disclose that I am an avid playing poker, so much of the terminology and phraseology came very naturally to me. I probably find much of the poker "action" to be more enthralling than those without this background, so I completely understand why some might get lost in the book's flow. However, I consider this a non-factor in my rating since she explains nearly all concepts that might not be obvious.
>
> That all being said, this book chronicles the journey of Maria Konnikova from psychology academic and journalist to professional poker player as a result of her mentor Erik Seidel - an accomplished World Series of Poker (WSOP) champion with multiple bracelets, a World Poker Tour (WPT) title, and tens of millions ($) in winnings - whose style of play is characteristically behavior-oriented in contrast with his math-oriented competitors. Her story starts out with an intense desire to test her academic findings from her research to better understand the role of luck in so-called "skilled endeavors"; her research focused on overconfidence and how the degree of an individual's locus of control affects his or her outcomes. After reading *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior* by John Von Neumann, Konnikova realized the uncertainty and inherent human element of deception in poker, rendering it unlike any other casino game; not purely luck; nor purely skill. Luck dominates the short-term; skill prevails the long-term, so long as one's foundation is strong. Realizing that poker is the perfect concoction of overconfident personalities, Konnikova decided to capitalize on the opportunity to parlay her psycholgoy background in order to disentangle skill from luck in one of the most competitive events in the world - the WSOP Main Event.
> 
> What I enjoy most about the book is that it is not merely a book on behavioral psychology / behavioral economics nor is it merely a *self-help* book. Rather, it is simply an account of her transformation from her fairly rigid academic thinking to her comprehensive real-world understanding of human behavior. Throughout this journey, her mindset evolves from the short-term focus of accomplishing the herculean goal of winning a WSOP Main Event (being overly-conscious about deadlines and milestones, etc) to the long-term retrospection of analyzing and assessing situations without complete information in all aspects of her life. 
> 
> As a poker fan, I find the detective work of Konnikova retracing the steps of her opponents using Seidel's principal advice, "pay attention", to deduce their most probable range of hands absolutely fascinating. As a reader, you experience her strategic competance and thought process unfold as if you were inside of her head during her wins and her "bad beats". She beautifully intertwines these episodes with her transformation as an individual, unobtrusively highlighting her incredible proclivity for self-reflection and self-improvement throughout her journey without the reader ever feeling lectured. However, these takeaways are not overt; especially not in a manner that would be consistent with the "self-help" category. She simply tells her story and highlights how each obstacle has made her stronger and taught her something new that she otherwise would never have learned in academia.

#### *The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey*
###### by Candice Millard
###### Pages: 416
###### My Rating: 5/5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/river_of_doubt.jpg?raw=true" alt="biggest_bluff" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/river_of_doubt.jpg?raw=true)

> The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey is a thrilling and captivating historical narrative by Candice Millard. The book tells the story of Theodore Roosevelt's journey down the little-known and treacherous River of Doubt (now known as the Rio Roosevelt) in Brazil in 1914.
> 
> The book is a beautifully written account of Roosevelt's journey, which was filled with danger, adventure, and near-death experiences. Anyone who knows me personally, knows that I am a huge fan of Theodore Roosevelt for precisely this reason; his mental fortitude to venture into the unknown and constantly strive for greatness. Millard brings to life the intense and often grueling nature of the expedition, as Roosevelt and his team faced obstacles such as treacherous rapids, deadly predators, and deadly diseases. Throughout the book, Millard paints a vivid picture of Roosevelt's resilience and determination in the face of these challenges. She also delves into the personal struggles and motivations of the other members of the expedition, including the Brazilian explorer Cândido Rondon, who accompanied Roosevelt on the journey.
> 
> Overall, The River of Doubt is a must-read for anyone interested in the life of Theodore Roosevelt or in the history of exploration. It is a testament to the human spirit and the indomitable will to survive against all odds.

#### *Ticker: The Quest to Create an Artificial Heart*
###### by Mimi Swartz
###### Pages: 336
###### My Rating: 5/5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/ticker.jpg?raw=true" alt="biggest_bluff" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/ticker.jpg?raw=true)

> Ticker: The Quest to Create an Artificial Heart is a fascinating and informative book by Mimi Swartz and Eric Topol. The book tells the story of the groundbreaking efforts (along with the associated societal repercussions and controversies) at the Texas Heart Institute to create an artificial heart that can replace the human heart when it fails. 
> 
> The book begins with the history of heart disease and the development of heart surgery, and then delves into the stories of the scientists, doctors, and patients who have been at the forefront of the quest for an artificial heart. Swartz and Topol do an excellent job of weaving together the scientific, medical, and personal aspects of this complex and challenging journey. While there are not traditional "characters" in the way that a work of fiction would have, the book highlights several individuals who have played key roles in the development and implementation of the artificial heart. These individuals include:
> 
- *Dr. Michael DeBakey*: A renowned cardiovascular surgeon and researcher who was one of the pioneers in the development of the artificial heart.
- *Dr. Robert Jarvik*: A medical inventor who developed one of the first successful artificial hearts, the Jarvik-7.
- *Dr. William DeVries*: The surgeon who implanted the Jarvik-7 into patient Barney Clark, making him the first person to receive an artificial heart.
- *Dr. Bud Frazier*: A cardiovascular surgeon and researcher who has been involved in the development of several artificial heart prototypes.
> 
> Throughout the book, the authors provide in-depth and engaging accounts of the various approaches that have been taken to create an artificial heart, including the development of mechanical hearts, heart assist devices, and even lab-grown hearts. They also explore the ethical and societal implications of such a revolutionary technology. These stories provide a human dimension to the scientific and technical aspects of the book and give a sense of the very real stakes involved in the quest to create an artificial heart.
> 
> Overall, Ticker is a must-read for anyone interested in the field of medicine, heart disease, or the intersection of science and society. It is a thought-provoking and highly informative look at one of the most ambitious and challenging endeavors in modern medicine.

#### *Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future*
###### by Peter Thiel & Blake Masters
###### Pages: 224
###### My Rating: 5/5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/zero_to_one.jpg?raw=true" alt="biggest_bluff" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/zero_to_one.jpg?raw=true)

> Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future is a must-read for anyone interested in entrepreneurship or innovation. In this highly influential and thought-provoking book, Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal and Palantir, offers his insights and strategies for building a successful startup.
> 
> One of the key themes of the book is the importance of creating something truly new and innovative (thinking "vertically" rather than "horizontally"), rather than simply copying what has already been done. Thiel argues that the biggest opportunities for growth and success come from creating "monopolies" in a new market or industry, rather than competing in an already crowded space.
> 
> In addition to offering practical advice for building a successful startup, Thiel also explores a wide range of topics, including the role of technology in shaping the future, the importance of culture and teamwork, and the challenges of scaling a business. He also debunks many of the myths and misconceptions that surround the world of startups, providing a realistic and nuanced view of what it takes to succeed in this competitive and fast-paced environment.
> 
> Overall, Zero to One is an excellent book that is both thought-provoking and actionable. It is a must-read for anyone looking to start a business who has the willingness to take calculated risks in order to make their vision a reality.

#### *Decision Points*
###### by George W. Bush
###### Pages: 481
###### My Rating: 5/5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/decision_pts.jpg?raw=true" alt="biggest_bluff" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/decision_pts.jpg?raw=true)

> Whether you love or hate him, this book provides surprising insight into the mind of George W. Bush and the major life decisions he has had to evaluate throughout his life. This is a refreshingly unique spin on an autobiography as it is not merely a chronology of his life, but rather a chronology of the events themselves. Most importantly, he offers honest and humble reflections that acknowledge his mistakes on the decisions he admittedly got wrong. I was always taught that in order to objectively judge someone's actions or character, you must hear both sides of the story.
> 
> Reading his take provides color into how he approached many topics that the media often sensationalized and reported in a biased manner. Many issues he faced, he took tremendous strides to hear from as many people from as many different backgrounds as he could before passing any sort of judgment. He worked with Ted Kennedy to try and fix the education system, he led the fight against HIV/AIDS in some of the poorest places on earth, improved medicare through the Medicare Modernization Act, helped Texas to become the leader in renewable energy, and most cemented in my mind having grown up 10 miles outside NYC was his ability to rally a nation at a time when everyone was in a state of panic and terror, yet made sure to respect the muslim faith during the aftermath by fighting for their right to peacefully worship as they saw fit. 
> 
> Despite the negative perception, I greatly appreciate this man and I truly believe he had this country's best interests at heart both when he was in office and out. Even if you wholeheartedly disagree with me, at least hear his point of view first before you judge him. I am confident that this book will leave you feeling otherwise.

#### *I Hear You: The Surprisingly Simple Skill Behind Extraordinary Relationships*
###### by Michael S Sorenson
###### Pages: 149
###### My Rating: 4/5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/i_hear_you.jpg?raw=true" alt="biggest_bluff" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/i_hear_you.jpg?raw=true)

> While the title may lead you to believe that this is a book about romantic relationship advice (which to an extent it is), there is much more to be gleaned from the author's insight into human nature and the social need for validation. The author gives countless examples of how to utilize otherwise common sense life principles (active listening, compassion, validation, etc) in all aspects of life to diffuse tense situations. Whether an argument with a spouse or collaboration with a stubborn co-worker or even how to fire someone in a way that de-escalates animosity toward one another (i.e. help them look for future work, etc). An unexpectedly splendid read.

#### *Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life*
###### by Nir Eyal
###### Pages: 290
###### My Rating: 3/5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/indistractable.jpg?raw=true" alt="biggest_bluff" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/indistractable.jpg?raw=true)

> It definitely has its merits and you will walk away with some good advice for time management. There were quite a few instances that seemed tangential and a lot of the material was fairly common sense. However, the author's writing style makes for an enjoyable read. The first half is about the 4 components of distractability: internal triggers, external triggers, traction, and distraction. The second half contains interesting applications of his method: in the workplace, raising children, and in a relationship.

#### *Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts*
###### by Annie Duke
###### Pages: 288
###### My Rating: 1/5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/thinking_bets.jpg?raw=true" alt="biggest_bluff" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/thinking_bets.jpg?raw=true)

> Admittedly, my 1/5 rating is a review in hindsight. After reading The Biggest Bluff, this book was a huge let down. It reiterated the same basic life lesson about taking calculated bets (i.e. risk) over and over and over again. Perhaps this might appeal to someone who has never read any basic psychology or economics text, but if not there are plenty of better options to choose from. As a statistician myself, I cannot help but also notice the fundamental gaps in some of the ways she describes Bayesian thinking. I could not be more relieved to finish this one.
