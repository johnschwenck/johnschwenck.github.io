> Easily one of the best books I've ever read. I must disclose that I am an avid playing poker, so much of the terminology and phraseology came very naturally to me. I probably find much of the poker "action" to be more enthralling than those without this background, so I completely understand why some might get lost in the book's flow. However, I consider this a non-factor in my rating since she explains nearly all concepts that might not be obvious.

> That all being said, this book chronicles the journey of Maria Konnikova from psychology academic and journalist to professional poker player as a result of her mentor Erik Seidel - an accomplished World Series of Poker (WSOP) champion with multiple bracelets, a World Poker Tour (WPT) title, and tens of millions ($) in winnings - whose style of play is characteristically behavior-oriented in contrast with his math-oriented competitors. Her story starts out with an intense desire to test her academic findings from her research to better understand the role of luck in so-called "skilled endeavors"; her research focused on overconfidence and how the degree of an individual's locus of control affects his or her outcomes. After reading *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior* by John Von Neumann, Konnikova realized the uncertainty and inherent human element of deception in poker, rendering it unlike any other casino game; not purely luck; nor purely skill. Luck dominates the short-term; skill prevails the long-term, so long as one's foundation is strong. Realizing that poker is the perfect concoction of overconfident personalities, Konnikova decided to capitalize on the opportunity to parlay her psycholgoy background in order to disentangle skill from luck in one of the most competitive events in the world - the WSOP Main Event.
> 
> What I enjoy most about the book is that it is not merely a book on behavioral psychology / behavioral economics nor is it merely a *self-help* book. Rather, it is simply an account of her transformation from her fairly rigid academic thinking to her comprehensive real-world understanding of human behavior. Throughout this journey, her mindset evolves from the short-term focus of accomplishing the herculean goal of winning a WSOP Main Event (being overly-conscious about deadlines and milestones, etc) to the long-term retrospection of analyzing and assessing situations without complete information in all aspects of her life. 
> 
> As a poker fan, I find the detective work of Konnikova retracing the steps of her opponents using Seidel's principal advice, "pay attention", to deduce their most probable range of hands absolutely fascinating. As a reader, you experience her strategic competance and thought process unfold as if you were inside of her head during her wins and her "bad beats". She beautifully intertwines these episodes with her transformation as an individual, unobtrusively highlighting her incredible proclivity for self-reflection and self-improvement throughout her journey without the reader ever feeling lectured. However, these takeaways are not overt; especially not in a manner that would be consistent with the "self-help" category. She simply tells her story and highlights how each obstacle has made her stronger and taught her something new that she otherwise would never have learned in academia.

#### *I Hear You: The Surprisingly Simple Skill Behind Extraordinary Relationships*
###### by Michael S Sorenson
###### My Rating: 4/5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/i_hear_you.jpg?raw=true" alt="biggest_bluff" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/i_hear_you.jpg?raw=true)

> While the title may lead you to believe that this is a book about romantic relationship advice (which to an extent it is), there is much more to be gleaned from the author's insight into human nature and the social need for validation. The author gives countless examples of how to utilize otherwise common sense life principles (active listening, compassion, validation, etc) in all aspects of life to diffuse tense situations. Whether an argument with a spouse or collaboration with a stubborn co-worker or even how to fire someone in a way that de-escalates animosity toward one another (i.e. help them look for future work, etc). An unexpectedly splendid read.

#### *Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life*
###### by Nir Eyal
###### My Rating: 3/5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/indistractable.jpg?raw=true" alt="biggest_bluff" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/indistractable.jpg?raw=true)

> It definitely has its merits and you will walk away with some good advice for time management. There were quite a few instances that seemed tangential and a lot of the material was fairly common sense. However, the author's writing style makes for an enjoyable read. The first half is about the 4 components of distractability: internal triggers, external triggers, traction, and distraction. The second half contains interesting applications of his method: in the workplace, raising children, and in a relationship.

#### *Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts*
###### by Annie Duke
###### My Rating: 1/5

> Admittedly, my 2/5 rating is a review in hindsight. After reading The Biggest Bluff, this book was a huge let down. It reiterated the same basic life lesson over and over and over again.
