> Simpler: The Future of Government is a well-written and fairly interesting read that explores the ways in which governments can become more efficient and effective in serving the needs of their citizens. Author Cass Sunstein argues that by streamlining regulations, cutting unnecessary bureaucracy, and using behavioral economics (implementing "nudges" - the seminal work of Sustein and Thaler) among other tools, governments can create a more simplified and user-friendly system that better meets the needs of their citizens.
> 
> The author recounts his experience working in OIRA for Barack Obama and how he led his organization to simplify and scale back on regulations through effective use of "nudges". He provides a truly unique perspective given his role within the government and there is much to be learned from how he dealt with the incessant pushback from special interest groups. To make objective and rational decisions, he would only come to conclusions after hearing various feedback from a wide, often conflicting, span of experts. 
> 
> One note definitely worth mentioning is that A LOT of what is discussed (this book was written in 2013) is extremely pertinent to the current state of the union in 2021/2022 with regard to current administration's the handling (or lack thereof) of the COVID-19 pandemic. I intentionally did not research anything about the author or where he stands politically on any current issues because I wanted to read with an objective unbiased mindset, so I am curious now if he still stands by his beliefs today as strongly as he did back then. Arguably the most central message from the book is that nudges should be used over mandates because nudges respect autonomy whereas mandates typically result in negative economic consequences in one form or another.
> 
> It did seem as though a lot of his work merely drew on Thinking Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (arguably my favorite book of all time) which was then applied to government problems. While I think this was a very interesting application, there wasn't particularly much novelty in my opinion. I admit I may be biased because I've read quite a bunch of these behavioral economics books lately. Personally, I found the book to be somewhat dry, and struggled to fully engage with the ideas presented. In general, the book seemed to drag on, and truth be told I was happy to be done with this one.

#### *1984*
###### by George Orwell
###### Pages: 328
###### My Rating: 5/5

> 1,000,000x better than the movie. Read this book. For as thrilling and intense as the storyline itself is, the political exposition of totalitarianism is hauntingly foreboding. 
> 
> A classic novel by George Orwell that remains as relevant and poignant today as it was upon its publication in 1949. The book is set in a dystopian society where the government wields complete control over every aspect of people's lives, and where truth and individuality are suppressed in favor of conformity and obedience.
> 
> The book's protagonist, Winston Smith, is a low-level bureaucrat who begins to question the oppressive regime in which he lives, and who becomes drawn into a dangerous rebellion against the government. Along the way, he encounters the mysterious and enigmatic Julia, who becomes his ally and lover in the fight against the system. He creates a vivid and believable world that is both terrifying and all too familiar, and his portrayal of the inner thoughts and motivations of the characters is masterful.
> 
> What makes 1984 such a masterpiece, in my opinion, is that Orwell beautifully juxtaposes such far-fetched subjective ideological extremes with objective literal contradictions, between free thought and individualism with groupthink and hysteria. For example, the Ministry of Truth is where the government administers propaganda and "corrects" history to reflect their own narrative, the Ministry of Peace is directly responsible for constantly waging war, the Ministry of Love serves to spy on its citizens (through "Big Brother") and convict them of "thoughtcrimes" by the Thought Police whenever they resist the mainstream narrative, and the Ministry of Plenty rations food and supplies without any interference from competition thus maintaining a perpetual state of poverty. Orwell also explores the concept of "doublethink," or the ability to hold two contradictory beliefs at the same time and believe them both to be true. This idea is closely tied to the concept of "newspeak," the government's attempt to control language and limit the ability of people to express dissenting ideas.
> 
> Some have argued that the philisophical political tangent during the middle of the book is too outwardly breaking the 4th wall, but I think this epitomizes the crux of the entire argument of the novel that summarizes the austerity of such despotic governments and the fallable and easily forgetful nature of society with respect to history. Without acknowledging the atrocities of the past in their full and complete account, society will be easily coerced by the state into violent hysteria. I loved every word of it. 
> 
> Overall, 1984 has officially taken my top spot in the fiction genre. I still have yet to read Brave New World, which I've heard is similarly prophetic, but for now 1984 is far and away my top fiction book. It is a powerful and timeless novel that continues to resonate with readers today as it did nearly 75 years ago.

#### *Ben Franklin*
###### by Walter Isaacson
###### Pages: 586
###### My Rating: 4 / 5

[<img align="left" hspace="20" src="https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/franklin.jpg?raw=true" alt="franklin" width="100"/>](https://github.com/johnschwenck/johnschwenck.github.io/blob/master/book_lists_and_reviews/book_images/franklin.jpg?raw=true)

> Benjamin Franklin: An American Life is a well-written and highly informative biography of one of America's most iconic and influential figures. Written by Walter Isaacson, the book offers a detailed and nuanced portrayal of Benjamin Franklin's life, from his humble beginnings as a printer's apprentice to his many accomplishments as a scientist, inventor, statesman, and writer.
> 
> One of the strengths of Isaacson's book is the way that he brings Franklin to life as a complex and multifaceted person. He covers all aspects of Franklin's life, including his early years as a printer and his later career as a scientist, politician, and diplomat, but doesn't shy away from discussing Franklin's flaws and weaknesses (namely his relationships and personal life). At the same time, he paints a vivid and engaging portrait of Franklin's many achievements and contributions to science, politics, and society.
> 
> In addition to providing a detailed account of Franklin's life and career, Isaacson also does an excellent job of placing Franklin's story in the broader context of the American Revolution and the founding of the United States. He provides insight into the major political and cultural events of the time, and shows how Franklin's ideas and actions played a key role in helping shape the course of American history, and how his legacy continues to influence the nation today.
> 
> Overall, Benjamin Franklin: An American Life is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in the life and times of Benjamin Franklin or in the history of the United States. It is a well-written and engaging book that provides a unique and illuminating perspective on one of the most important figures in American history; however, it falls short of other Isaacson biographies that I've read in the past, ever so slightly.
