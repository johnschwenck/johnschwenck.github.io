> For those who know me well, I am an avid reader. While I do tend to have a proclivity toward literature in the biographical and historical domains, I strive to read comprehensively across many genres. I believe that expanding one's scope of literature leads to much more nuanced discussion surrounding current events as a result of gaining a more enriched intellectual diversity and perspective, even if such literature is seemingly disparate from the matter at hand. I have therefore created a few posts below that serve as reviews of books I've read over a given year in addition to a general "All-time Favorites List" that spans all books I've ever read. These lists are by no means official or exhaustive, they are merely for enjoyment and discussion. If you have any interest in discussing any of the listed titles or have any further suggestions for future reading, definitely reach out!
