### *[iglu](https://github.com/irinagain/iglu)*: Interpreting Glucose Data from Continuous Glucose Monitors
***iglu*** provides functions for outputting relevant metrics for data collected from Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM) and can be utilized on any dataset containing the necessary CGM data fields. See [Rodbard (2009)](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/dia.2008.0132) for reference. The package is the result of a team effort led by [Dr. Gaynanova](https://github.com/irinagain) and her Aggie Research Program team and a research collaboration with Johns Hopkins University. ***iglu*** is currently available on both [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iglu/index.html) (ver 3.0.0) and [GitHub](https://github.com/irinagain/iglu).

### ***[bp](https://github.com/johnschwenck/bp)***: Blood Pressure Analysis in R
The **bp** package is the first open source R software package dedicated to analyzing blood pressure using various medical metrics from the Hypertension literature in addition to a suite of continuously-improving visualizations. The package is equipped with 6 publicly available data sets (4 HBPM data sets, 1 ABPM data set, and 1 AP data set) and also allows users to import and process their own data into a unified format. In addition to metrics and standalone visuals, the package has the ability to create a report for clinical use to summarize a given patients blood pressure trends. The ***bp*** package is available on both [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bp/index.html) (ver 2.0.0) and [GitHub](https://github.com/johnschwenck/bp).

The ***bp*** package was presented at the 2021 R/Medicine Conference. The poster can be found [here](https://johnschwenck.github.io/img/R_Med_Poster_bp.pdf).

### ***[bp Shiny App](https://github.com/irinagain/bpshiny)***: A Web-based User Interface for the *bp* Package via Shiny
As a programming-free alternative to the ***bp*** R package, a Shiny app has been developed to allows all users to easily analyze their own data withou the need to know the R programming language. This project is still in development and is set to be published to a public URL by Fall 2021.

### Riding For Research: NYC to Alaska
In the summer of 2019, I rode my bicycle 5,775 miles from New York City, New York to Seward, Alaska in an effort to collect various high-resolution geospatial and biometric data, including continuous heart rate, blood pressure, spatial coordinates, weather, and nearly 50 others. The data is all currently hosted on the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/r4r) and the final Power BI dashboard is available [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjdmYTAzMmEtZjllZS00Mzg4LTljZDMtMTQ1Y2EyODJkNmQ1IiwidCI6IjY4ZjM4MWUzLTQ2ZGEtNDdiOS1iYTU3LTZmMzIyYjhmMGRhMSIsImMiOjN9) (and in the dashboard tab at the top of this page), but I am still working on migrating all of my code to a public GitHub repository. The estimated completion date for this migration is end of 2020.
